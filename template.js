/*
    Template Literals in JavaScript are a modern way to work with strings, introduced in ES6.
They allow you to:
✔ Write strings in multiple lines
✔ Insert variables directly into strings
✔ Embed expressions inside strings

They use backticks instead of quotes:
*/

//without template literals
let fname = 'ram'
let lname = 'babu'
let city = 'chennai'

console.log('my name is' + fname +  ' ' +  lname + 'lives in' + ' '+ city)

 let msg = `my name is ${fname} ${lname} lives in ${city}`
 console.log(msg)
