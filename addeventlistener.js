/*
addEventListener() in JavaScript is a method used to listen for user actions (events) on an element and run a function when that event happens.

Simple Explanation

It tells the browser:
“When the user does this action, run this code.”

Syntax
element.addEventListener("eventName", function);

Real-Life Example

Imagine a doorbell.
When someone presses the button (event), the bell rings (function).

Similarly, when someone clicks a button on a webpage, JavaScript can run a function.

Why addEventListener() is Useful?

✔ Add multiple events to same element
✔ Keep JavaScript separate from HTML
✔ Better performance & flexibility
✔ Works for modern features like keydown, scroll, input, etc.
